# Modularization and Migration Task Log

**Date:** 2025-06-21

## What Has Been Done

- **Initialized a new Ansible collection** at `/Users/tmwsiy/code/terminal` for modular, open-source terminal automation.
- **Created modular role directories**: `user_setup`, `tool_installer`, `nvm`, `pyenv`, `rustup`, and `profile`.
- **Copied the original role's contents** as a starting point for modularization.
- **Added collection metadata** (`galaxy.yml`) and `.gitignore`.
- **Prepared for migration of documentation and further refactoring.**

## Reference: Source Role

The original monolithic role is:

- **Role name:** `terminal_setup`
- **Path:** `/Users/tmwsiy/code/gaia-infra-platform/ansible/roles/terminal_setup`

This role remains intact as a reference for logic, templates, and documentation during the modularization process.

---

**Next Steps:**
- Migrate and split logic from the original role into the new modular roles.
- Move and update documentation.
- Refactor and test each new role individually.

*This file tracks major migration and architectural decisions for future contributors.*
